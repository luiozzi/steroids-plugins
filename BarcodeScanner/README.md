# Barcode Scanner plugin for iOS and Android

Source code, readme and usage instructions for the Barcode Scanner plugin included with AppGyver Steroids can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AppGyver/BarcodeScanner).
## Usage with Steroids

The Barcode Scanner plugin is bundled in with AppGyver Scanner, so there's no need to install it separately. Cordova also automatically loads the JavaScript file and creates a `window.cordova.plugins.barcodeScanner` object in all WebViews.
