# Google Analytics Cordova plugin for iOS

Readme and usage instructions for the Google Analytics plugin can be found at the [official repo](https://github.com/phonegap-build/GAPlugin).

## Usage with Steroids

The Google Analytics plugin is bundled in with AppGyver Scanner for iOS, so there's no need to install it separately. Cordova also automatically loads the JavaScript file and creates a `window.GAPlugin` object in all WebViews.
